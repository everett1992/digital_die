# Digital Die

This is my first hardware project, a 'pocket' calculator for D&D and games that use dice.

 - [feather m0 express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3403)
 - [128x32 2.3" OLED](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2675)
 - 14 cherry mx knockoff switches
 - [2200mAh lithium ion battery](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1781)

You can find significanly cheaper micro controllers and displays, I would shop
around before building another.
